### BEMP’s Continued Educational Support Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic

Hello New Mexico Community!

BEMP fully supports the Governor’s instructions for physical distancing in order to slow the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. We really miss seeing you in the bosque and in classrooms!  Even though we can’t see you in person, we are committed to delivering environmental education and will do our best to support you from afar!

BEMP will be creating weekly activities that we will share here http://bemp.org/education-resources/ and as printed copies (stay tuned for more information about how we are working together with our fellow NM educational partners on this!).
